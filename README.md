# Billing-Software
This is a sample billing app based on GUI.

Step 1:
First we need to setup the VS code editor and install the python externally from any web browser.

Step 2:
Then we have to create a folder with a name of our choice to store the python code file and another sub folder where the bills would be stored.

Step 3:
After the full setup and  creation of all files and folders open the terminal and run the program using the command:python bill.py(python file_name.py).

Step 4:
After running the program the software app will open where the customer details are must(name and phone number) and we have to select atleast one product without which it will show an error message.

step 5:
After each generation of a bill a message box pops up to ask if we want to save the bill or not. If we selct yes then the bill gets saved in the sub-folder(named bills) but if we selct no then the bill is not saved.

Step 5:
After each generation of a bill we have to clear the details with the help of the clear button provided or else no new bill number would be generated the changes for the nest customer would be made in the current bill number.  When we click the clear button a message box pops up to ask if we want to clear or not and set all the variables to the default value. If we selct yes then everything is set to their default values but if we selct no then no changes is made.

Step 6:
There is also an exit button to exit from the app. When we click the exit button a message box pops up to ask if we want to exit or not. If we selct yes then we get exited from the app but if we selct no then no then we stay in the app.
